Please run the following code during the break to install bioconductor and a few packages useful for statistical analysis:

```
install.packages(c("corrplot", "gplots"))
# install bioconductor and the multtest package
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("multtest", version = "3.8")
```
