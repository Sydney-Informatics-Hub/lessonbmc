## Controls & Loops

These allow you to control the flow of execution of a script. Common ones include:

* if, else
* for
* while
* break
* next
* function

### If statements

~~~
if (condition_is_satisfied)
{
    # do something
}
~~~
{: .language-r}

Sometimes, we want to do something even if the `if` statement returns `FALSE`. In such a case, we use an `else` statement
### If-else statements

~~~
if (condition_is_satisfied)
{
  # do something
} else
{
  # do something else
}
~~~
{: .language-r}

Hadley Wickham has published a [style guide for R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).

*“An opening curly brace should never go on its own line and should always be followed by a new line. A closing curly brace should always go on its own line, unless it’s followed by else. Always indent the code inside curly braces.”*


### If-else statement with clearer legibility

~~~
if (condition_is_satisfied) {
  # do something
} else {
  # do something else
}
~~~
{: .language-r}


For example:

~~~
x <- 1
if (x > 1) {
  print("x is greater than 1")
} else {
  print("x is less than 1")
}
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "x is less than 1"
~~~
{: .output}


### If, else if and else statements

~~~
if (condition1_is_satisfied) {
  # do something
} else if (condition2_is_satisfied) {
  # do something else
} else {
  # do something different
}
~~~
{: .language-r}

For example:

~~~
x <- 1
if (x > 1) {
  print("x is greater than 1")
} else if ( x < 1) {
  print ("x is less than 1")
} else {
  print("x is equal to 1")
}
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "x is equal to 1"
~~~
{: .output}


## Quiz

Imagine a patient has just completed the SF-36 questionnaire and we have calcualted that this patient has a MHI5 score of 45.

Write a set of if-else statements that will test the variable `mhi5_score`. Print out the characters “mental ill-health” if it is less than 52 and “good mental health” if it is greater than or equal to 52

~~~
mhi5_score <- 45

# put your if-else statements here
~~~
{: .language-r}


## For loops

For loops works on an iterable variable and assigns successive values till the end of a sequence.


~~~
for (i in 1:10) {
    print(i)
}
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1
[1] 2
[1] 3
[1] 4
[1] 5
[1] 6
[1] 7
[1] 8
[1] 9
[1] 10
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
fruits <- c("apples", "oranges", "bananas", "strawberries")

for (i in 1:4) {
    print(fruits[i])
}
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "apples"
[1] "oranges"
[1] "bananas"
[1] "strawberries"
~~~
{: .output}


~~~
for (fruit in fruits) {
    print(fruit)
}
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "apples"
[1] "oranges"
[1] "bananas"
[1] "strawberries"
~~~
{: .output}

We can shorthand this into one-line (coders love one-liners)

~~~
for (fruit in fruits) print(fruit)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "apples"
[1] "oranges"
[1] "bananas"
[1] "strawberries"
~~~
{: .output}


### For loop examples
We’ve seen that we can use `for` loops for vectors. We can also use `for` loops for data frames. Let's read in our dataset from last week with the same modifications

~~~
autism.data <- read.csv(file = "data/autism_data.csv",
                        header = TRUE,
                        sep = ",",
                        na.strings = "?")

# rename the column with the typo
colnames(autism.data)[17] <- "country"

# make a new column of patient IDs called pids
new_ids <- paste( "PatientID_" , autism.data$id, sep = "")
autism.data$pids <- new_ids

# remove the patient who was 383 years old
autism.data <- autism.data[-which.max(autism.data$age), ]

# split into those with family history of autism
family.autism.data <- autism.data[autism.data$autism == "yes", ]
~~~
{: .language-r}

We can traverse across each row of the data frame using a `for` loop and print out the `age`

~~~
# for each row, print the participant's age
numrows <- nrow(autism.data)
for (i in 1:numrows) {
  print(autism.data[i, "age"])
}
~~~
{: .language-r}

Or traverse across each column of the data frame

~~~
# for each column, print the column data type using the class function
for (i in 1:ncol(autism.data)) {
  columndata <- autism.data[ ,i]
  print(class(columndata))
}
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] "integer"
[1] "integer"
[1] "integer"
[1] "integer"
[1] "integer"
[1] "integer"

~~~

### For-loops and if statements
We can incorporate our knowledge of `if` statements with `for` loops.

~~~
# for each row, if the participant is ASD, print out their test result
numrows <- nrow(autism.data)
for (i in 1:numrows) {
  if (autism.data[i, "Class.ASD"] == "YES"){
    print(autism.data[i, "result"])
  }
}
~~~
{: .language-r}

##Quiz

1. Write code such that, for each row in the autism.data data frame, test whether the participant is ASD. If so, then print out "ASD" and if not, print out "Not ASD"

~~~
# for each row, if the participant is ASD, print out their test result
numrows <- nrow(autism.data)
for (i in 1:numrows) {

  # write your code here

}
~~~
{: .language-r}


2. (Intermediate level) Write code such that, for each row in the autism.data data frame, test whether the participant is ASD and has a `result` score greater than or equal to 9. If so, then print out "High ASD" and if not, print out "Otherwise"

~~~
# for each row, if the participant is ASD, print out their test result
numrows <- nrow(autism.data)
for (i in 1:numrows) {

  # write your code here

}
~~~
{: .language-r}


### While loop

~~~
i <- 1
while (i < 10) {
    print(i)
    i <- i + 1
}
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

Be sure there is a way to exit out of a while loop. Otherwise, you can get stuck in an infinite loop. Below is an example of one.

~~~
# don't run this
i <- 1
while (i < 10) {
  print(i)
}
~~~
{: .language-r}


### Break statement

A break statement is used in a loop to stop the iterations and flow the control outside of the loop.

~~~
x <- 1:10
for (i in x){
  if (i == 2){
     break
  }
  print(i)
}
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 1
~~~
{: .output}

### Next statement

Next statement enables to skip the current iteration of a loop without terminating it.

~~~
x <- 1:4
for (i in x) {
  if (i == 2){
    next
  }
  print(i)
}
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~

## User-defined functions

If you have to repeat the same few lines of code more than once, then you really need to write a function. Functions are a fundamental building block of R. You use them all the time in R and it's not that much harder to string functions together (or write entirely new ones from scratch) to do more.


For example:

~~~
# Make a function that performs addition
add <- function(a, b) {
    return(a + b)
}

add(2, 5)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 7
~~~
{: .output}


### Example
Create a function that accepts a data frame and returns the mean of the "age" column

~~~
findMeanAge <- function(somedataframe) {
  ages <- 0

  for (i in 1:nrow(somedataframe)){
    ages <- ages + somedataframe[i, "age"]
  }

  mean_age <- ages / nrow(somedataframe)

  return(mean_age)
}
~~~
{: .language-r}


Now we can use this function on any data set with an `age` column

~~~
findMeanAge(family.autism.data)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 33.75824
~~~
{: .output}

If, however, there is already a function to perform what you need, save time and use that instead.

~~~
findMeanAge(autism.data)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] NA
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
mean(autism.data$age, na.rm = TRUE)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 29.19401
~~~

## Data wrangling

![](tidyr.jpg) #corrected here from tidyverse_website.png not sure if this is intended behavior TODO

So far, we've been using R's base functions to perform our data wrangling and manipulation. I would highly encourage you to learn to use the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) collection of data wrangling and visualisation tools. These are excellent tools that allows you to write elegent, legible code that gets your data into the right shape prior to analysis.

## haven

 TODO add haven logo here

haven is a package within the tidyverse that allows you to read in data from different sources. For example, if our autism dataset was saved as an .sav file (SPSS), we can use `haven` to read that in.


~~~
# load haven
library(haven)
#autism.data.spss <- read_spss("data/autism_data.sav") #TODO LOAD THIS DATA????
~~~
{: .language-r}


Next, we'll step into one of the most popular tidyverse package called [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/).

## dpylr

TODO add hex-dplyr.jpeg

`dpylr` allows you to perform some of the most common data manipulation tasks you'll encounter in R. The background of the `dplyr` package is that it is a "grammar" of data manipulation and that its functions are a set of verbs.

You will also notice that the spelling follows British spelling rather than American (Hadley Wickham, author and maintainer of the tidyverse, is from New Zealand), but they can actually be used interchangeably. For example, `summarise()` and `summarize()` perform the same function.

### select()
The `select()` function allows you to pick or remove variables based on their names. Note that you do not use `"` nor `'` to wrap the column names as you would with a base R function


~~~
# select just the age, gender and result columns from autism.data
selected.autism.data <- select(autism.data, age, gender, result)
head(selected.autism.data)
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  age gender result

2  24      m      5
3  27      m      8
4  35      f      6
5  40      f      2
6  36      m      9
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
# select all columns except for ethnicity and country

~~~
{: .output}

The tidyverse allows you to pipe functions together to create a chain to data manipulations. This allows you to redirect the output of one function into another one. Those familiar with bash or *nix will be familiar with piping with `|`. Here, we use `%>%` to pipe.

This makes each step discrete and helps immensely with readability


~~~
autism.data %>% select(age, gender, result) %>% head()
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  age gender result
1  26      f      6
2  24      m      5
3  27      m      8
4  35      f      6
5  40      f      2
6  36      m      9
~~~
{: .output}

Or let's make this more legible

~~~
autism.data %>%
  select(age, gender, result) %>%
  head()
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  age gender result
1  26      f      6
2  24      m      5
3  27      m      8
4  35      f      6
5  40      f      2
6  36      m      9
~~~
{: .output}

Redirect the output of this chain of pipes into a new dataframe

~~~
autism.data %>%
  select(age, gender, result) -> selected.autism.data
~~~
{: .language-r}


### filter()
The `filter()` function allows you to filter rows of your dataset that match some condition. We can also combine this with some of R' base functions. Here, we'll use `head()` to restrict the output number of rows

~~~
autism.data %>%
  filter(age == 17) %>%
  head()
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
  id A1_Score A2_Score A3_Score A4_Score A5_Score A6_Score A7_Score

### summarise() and group_by()
The `summarise()` function reduces down multiple values into one summary statistic. To do so, we need to tell R which groups we're interested in summarising our data into. To do so, we need to use the `group_by()` function prior to calling `summarise()`

~~~
autism.data %>%
  group_by(Class.ASD) %>%
  summarise(meanage = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
            count = n())
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
# A tibble: 2 x 3
  Class.ASD meanage count
  <fct>       <dbl> <int>
1 NO           28.4   514
2 YES          31.3   189
~~~
{: .output}

You can group by more than one variable

~~~
autism.data %>%
  group_by(Class.ASD, gender) %>%
  summarise(mean.age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
            max.age = max(age, na.rm = TRUE),
            min.age = min(age, na.rm = TRUE),
            count = n())
~~~
